In this example, a user swaps 5 of token A for 1 of token B from the system wallet.

To run this example, execute the following command:```yarn swap
```Burn NFT Transaction

In this example, a user burns a valid NFT from a collection for a fixed reward of 10 of token B.

Note: This instruction will fail because you don't have an NFT from the valid collection to burn.

To run this example, execute the following command:```yarn burn
```Paid Update NFT Transaction
